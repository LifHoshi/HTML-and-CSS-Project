# HTML-and-CSS-Project
This repository tracks my journey in learning HTML and CSS.

There are three types of CSS(Cascading Style Sheet). 
1. Inline CSS(Most often combined with Javascript). e.g.  "<p style="color:#009900; font-size:50px; font-style:italic; text-align:center;>"
2. Internal of Embedded CSS. This is creating a <style> tab and putting it between <title> and "<head>". This is more friendly to newbies
3. External CSS. Namely, create a CSS file outside of an HTML file. We could use the command <link> when invoking this CSS file in HTML. This is widely used in work conditions.
