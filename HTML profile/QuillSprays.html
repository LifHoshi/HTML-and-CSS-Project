  <ul> 
    <li>Interrupts Bristleback's channeling abilities upon cast.</li>
    <li>Grants 1 <a href = "Bristleback.html">Warpath</a> stack upon cast. </li>
    <li>The quills spread at a speed of 2400 and take 0.29 seconds to reach maximum range.</li>
    <li>The quills do not form a ring. They affect every enemy within the expanding area of effect, so it cannot be avoided by blinking towards Bristleback.</li>
    <li>The effect is centered at the cast location, it does not follow Bristleback.</li>
    <li>Places one debuff on each hit enemy and a stack debuff on each cast on each hit enemy.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Places one debuff on each hit enemy and a stack debuff on each cast on each hit enemy.</li>
      <li>The first debuff shows the number of stack debuffs on the status icon. The stack debuffs are hidden.</li>
      <li>The stacks' durations are independent of each other. Successive casts do not refresh previous stacks' durations.</li>
      <li>With the current cooldown and stack duration, it can be stacked up to 5 times. To reach the damage cap, additional passive procs from <a href="Bristleback.html">Bristleback</a> ability icon Bristleback are required.</li>
    </ul>
