  <h3><strong>Takes reduced damage when facing away from enemies.</strong></h3>
  <p style = "display:inline-block;">The enforcer at a local pub, Rigwarl's never failed to collect a tab. <br />
    That is, until he met one tough customer from the north. For the first time in his life, 
    Rigwarl felt the need to train. <br /> His Thorny Back deters attacks while peppering foes with constant barrages of <a href="QuillSprays.html" target="_blank">Quill Sprays.</a><br />
    From his nose he blows <a href="#"> Thick Gobs of Snot</a>, slowing and covering opponents in goo. <br />When it comes to a fight, 
    he really puts his back into it. With every volley and every Sneeze, Rigwarl works himself into a fury, 
    <br />adding rage to each blow as he goes on the Warpath in search of a rematch</p>
